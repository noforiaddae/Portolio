# Movie Correlation Project
For the movie correlation project in Python, the main objective was to look at the correlation between two columns from the table.
I used the scatterplot chart to show this correlation. I used seaborn and matplotlib to showcase different scatterplot charts.
I also tested out the different correlation methods and also plotted a correlation matrix.



# COVID Project
For the COVID Project in SQL, there were two tables to look at - COVID deaths and COVID vaccinations. I looked at total cases
vs total deaths in the USA in the COVID deaths table. I also looked at the number of countries with the highest death count per 
population from the COVID deaths table. I joined both tables and looked at total population vs the number of vaccinations. 


# Nashville Housing Project
For the Nashville Housing Project in SQL, I separated an address column into 3 more columns to show address, city and state. I updated
the table to show the newly added columns. I also removed null values from the table and removed duplicates. 


#Excel Project
For the Excel Project, I practiced using formulas like vlookup, concatenate, mid, left and IF statement. I created two pivot tables 
and created graphs.  I also solved two problem questions.
